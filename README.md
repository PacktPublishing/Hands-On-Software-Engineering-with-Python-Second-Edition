Software engineering is more than coding; it’s the strategic design and continuous improvement of systems that serve real-world needs. This newly updated second edition of Hands-On Software Engineering with Python expands on its foundational approach to help you grow into a senior or staff-level engineering role.
Fully revised for today’s Python ecosystem, this edition includes updated tooling, practices, and architectural patterns. You’ll explore key changes across five minor Python versions, examine new features like dataclasses and type hinting, and evaluate modern tools such as Poetry, pytest, and GitHub Actions. A new chapter introduces high-performance computing in Python, and the entire development process is enhanced with cloud-readiness in mind.
You’ll follow a complete redesign and refactor of a multi-tier system from the first edition, gaining insight into how software evolves—and what it takes to do that responsibly. From system modeling and SDLC phases to data persistence, testing, and CI/CD automation, each chapter builds your engineering mindset while updating your hands-on skills.
By the end of this book, you'll have mastered modern Python software engineering practices and be equipped to revise and future-proof complex systems with confidence.</details>

  <summary><h2>Requirements for this book</summary>
This book assumes that you’re already familiar with Python and ready to go a level deeper — from
simply writing code to understanding how and why software systems are built the way they are.
You don’t need to be an expert, but you should be comfortable with the basics of Python and the
development environment around it. Specifically, you should know how to:
<ul>
  <li> Download and install Python (the examples were written using Python 3.11, but they should work with later versions as well) </li>
 <li> Write and use Python functions </li>
 <li> Define and work with basic classes </li> 
 <li> Install packages using pip, and import functionality from installed modules </li>
 <li> Organize code using modules and packages across files and folders </li>
</ul>
The examples in this book are operating system–agnostic, and no specific IDE or editor is required
— you can work in whatever environment you’re comfortable with.
You won’t need an AWS account to get started, but the
Later chapters that cover cloud deployment and infrastructure-as-code will guide you through
what’s needed when you get there, and are deigned to be applied in an AWS account, even if it
is a temporary one.
